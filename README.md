RomanNumerals
=============

An implementation of the Roman Numerals kata in Elixir inspired by [Corey Haines' approach](http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html).

## Running the tests
Run `mix test`. If you have ruby installed you can also use the included Guardfile together with the [guard-elixir](https://github.com/webcoyote/guard-elixir) plugin to have the tests run automatically when changing the tests or the implementation. I've included a Gemfile so that you can install the guard-elixir gem by running `bundle install`.
